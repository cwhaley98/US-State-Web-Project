# US-State-Web-Project
In this project, I have built a multi page website about one of the states within the US. This demonstrates the basic skills of HTML and CSS usage with a simple layout to maintain consistency.

This site also includes a form page that asks the user to fill out the necessary fields and "submit". DISCLAIMER: This form is NOT functional.
