                <p>The State of Washington is located in the Pacific Northwest 
                    region of the United States. Most of the time it is referred as <strong>Washington state</strong> to 
                    to separate it from the national capital, <strong>Washington, D.C.</strong>. 
                    In fact both these locations have been named for <em>George Washington</em> who was the United States 1st president.
                    The states capital is Olympia and its largest city is Seattle which are both located in the southwestern part of Washington just 
                    approximately 60 miles from each other.
                </p>

                <p>Washington state was formed as part of the western part of the Washington Territory. 
                    Surrounding its border is the Pacific Ocean, Oregon, Idaho, 
                    and the Canadian province of British Columbia. 
                    In 1846, the British Empire ceded Washington to the 
                    United States under the Oregon Treaty, and by 1889 Washington offically became the 42nd state to be admitted to the Union.
                </p>

                <p>Like the rest of the United States, there remains thousands of years of Native American history 
                    before the times of early European and American exploration and establishing territorial claims.
                    But based on archaeological evidence that areas in the Pacific Northwest shows being one of the first populated areas in North America.

                    <p>The state nickname is unofficially known as "The Evergreen State", this is 
                        because from 1890 when it was originally proposed, evergreen trees populated all 
                        over the forests of Washington and the amount of rain would keep the grasses and 
                        trees green throughout the year.
                    </p>
                    <p> There are multiple symbols that Washington state recognizes in their honor. 
                        Here are just some examples of the state symbols:
                            <ul>
                                <li>State Bird: American Goldfinch</li>
                                <li>State Vegetable: Walla Walla Sweet Onion</li>
                                <li>State Tree: Western Hemlock</li>
                                <li>State Flower: Coast Rhododendron</li>
                            </ul><br>
                        There is a popular and widely accepted state rock song, <em>Louie Louie</em> by <em>Richard Berry</em>, 
                        although it is an unofficial title.
                    </p>

                        Washington is also known for having significant bussinesses running within the state including aircraft (Boeing), software development (Microsoft, Amazon, Valve, Bungie, Blizzard), 
                        telecom (T-Mobile), lumber, and retail (Nordstrom, Costco, Starbucks). Washington has also been the home of
