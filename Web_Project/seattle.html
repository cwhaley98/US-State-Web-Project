                    Seattle is located in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. It is known as a sea port 
                    due to being between the saltwater Puget Sound on its western banks, and Lake Washington on its eastern banks. 
                    Despite Olympia being the Capital of Washington, Seattle is the states most populous city, its metropolitan area's population is 
                    said to currently be at 4.02 million, making it one of Americas fastest growing cities with a steady 21% percent growth rate between 2010 and 2020.
                    Seattle is a gateway for trade with East Asia due to being an oceanic port, with the Port of Seattle being the 4th largets port in North America. 
                    The culture of Seattle is majorily defined by its musical industry and history. Jazz musicians Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, and Ernestine Anderson nurtured their early careers in Seattle, and the city was also 
                    origin to serveral rock bands such as Foo Fighters, Heart, Jimi Hendrix, and bands within the subgenre of grunge including Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and others.

                    Four thousand years before the first permanent European settlers, Seattle was originally inhabited by Native Americans.
                    Around 1851, a group formally known as the <em>Denny Party</em> lead by <em>Arthur A. Denny</em> travelled from Illinois via the schooner <em>Exact</em> 
                    at Alki Point which was the orignal settlement in Seattle. Later the settlement had been moved to Elliot Bay in 1852 and was offically named "Seattle" in honor of Chief Seattle, 
                    who was a prominent leader in the 19th century of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes. Now in modern days, Seattle has a high population 
                    of Native Americans alongside Americans and with strong Asian, African, European, and Scandinavian ancestry.

                    Seattle's first big industry was logging, although by the 19th century had grown as a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway for Alaska 
                    during the Klondike Gold Rush. After World War II, the city grew more thanks to the Boeing Company and established Seattle as a center for manufacturing aircraft.
                    During the 1980s, Seattle had started to development into a technological center, Microsoft Founder Bill Gates established their headquarters within the region, 
                    and in 1994 Amazon was later founded in Seattle. Not to mention the Alaska Airlines is based in SeaTac, Washington serving as the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. 
                    With the rise of new software and biotechology, this led to an economic boom for Seattle which increased the city population heavily between 1990 and 2000.
